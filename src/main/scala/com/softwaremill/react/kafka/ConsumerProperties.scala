  /**
   * Consumer Properties
   *
   * brokerList
   * This is for bootstrapping and the producer will only use it for getting metadata (topics, partitions and replicas).
   * The socket connections for sending the actual data will be established based on the broker information returned in
   * the metadata. The format is host1:port1,host2:port2, and the list can be a subset of brokers or a VIP pointing to a
   * subset of brokers.
   *
   * zooKeeperHost
   * Specifies the zookeeper connection string in the form hostname:port where host and port are the host and port of
   * a zookeeper server. To allow connecting through other zookeeper nodes when that zookeeper machine is down you can also
   * specify multiple hosts in the form hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3. The server may also have a zookeeper
   * chroot path as part of it's zookeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global zookeeper namespace.
   * If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of /chroot/path
   * you would give the connection string as hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path.
   *
   * topic
   * The high-level API hides the details of brokers from the consumer and allows consuming off the cluster of machines
   * without concern for the underlying topology. It also maintains the state of what has been consumed. The high-level API
   * also provides the ability to subscribe to topics that match a filter expression (i.e., either a whitelist or a blacklist
   * regular expression).  This topic is a whitelist only but can change with re-factoring below on the filterSpec
   *
   * groupId
   * A string that uniquely identifies the group of consumer processes to which this consumer belongs. By setting the same
   * group id multiple processes indicate that they are all part of the same consumer group.
